# LineFollower

## Task requirements

Given a kit with all the basic components and a boilerplate code, we needed to assemble the car and fine-tune the PID controller.

## Context

The line follower project consists of a little robot made from the components listed below, that has to complete a course (white background with a black stripe) following the black line and completing a full lap in the fastest time (best out of 3 laps).

## Grading:

- Implement calibration with automatic motor movement
- Follow a curved line (not exaggerated)
- Finish the line follower course
- Finish the line follower course in a fast manner with visible control (implementing P, D and maybe I)

## Components:

- Arduino Uno
- Zip-ties
- A LiPo battery
- 2 wheels
- Wires
- QTR-8A reflectance sensor, along with screws
- Ball caster
- Extra wires from the kit or lab
- Chassis
- Breadboard
- L293D motor driver
- 2 DC motors
